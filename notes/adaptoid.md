##About the Adaptoidâ„¢

The Adaptoid is the ultimate N64 to PC interface. It's powerful, compact and easy to use and requires no additional hardware or power source to run. What's more, the Adaptoid is actually two products in one!

Use the Adaptoid to plug your N64 controller right into the USB port of your computer and you can play games on your computer using your N64 controller! The Adaptoid will work on computers with Windows 98, Windows 2000, or Mac OS. Just imagine, you can use the N64 controller you already own and are familiar with to play games on your computer. But there's more! The Adaptoid also supports the Rumble Pak with games that support DirectX force feedback. Feel the power and excitement as you do battle! Oh yeah, one last thing... there's no calibration required - its all automatic. Just plug it in and you're good to go!

The Adaptoid can also be used to store Nintendo game saves to your PC - extending the storage capacity of your Memory Paks to the size of your PC hard drive. This feature requires Windows 98. The included software will allow you to upload and download the data at the click of a button. You'll be able to store all your game saves in one place and even share them with your friends. Your game saves can be e-mailed or posted on websites for everyone to envy and enjoy! If you feel sorry for some loser gamer, you can share your superior game saves with them (after they pay homage to you, of course).
